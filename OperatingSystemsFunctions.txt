One function of an operating system is executing programs and software. Every OS needs to be able to run specific code that can be designed for it and some operating systems do it differently. In order to execute software you also need to have a user interface so you can actually interact with the programs. 
Another function of an operating system is the user interface. You have to be able to see what you're doing on an operating system on a screen or display device. The most common types of interactions are clicks, keystrokes, or manual taps (mobile devices). A lot of operating systems try and make a very presentable and clean user interface to make the experience better.
